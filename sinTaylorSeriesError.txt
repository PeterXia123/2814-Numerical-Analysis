
the compute forward error is not within the theoritical error
because 1/fact(23)=3.8682*e^-23
the value is less than 2.220446e^-16
don't satisfy our assumption

why it is not smoothy 
because the estimation only count the first 10 terms.
 so the difference |sin(x)-t10| are not exact 0 and since there is machine epision so the value round up and down accounding to floating-point function
that why we see it fluactuation instead of move steadily.
